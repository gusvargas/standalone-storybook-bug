# standalone-storybook-bug

https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/16526

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. `yarn`
1. `yarn serve-standalone-storybook` (serves the assets generated by parcel in the [standalone-preview](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/examples/standalone-preview) example)
1. `yarn storybook` (sets `--preview-url`)
1. Navigate to http://localhost:6006/
1. Observe that the `path` query param was not automatically applied on initial page load
1. Click on any of the addon toolbar button, e.g., the outlines button.
1. Observe that the iframe now appears blank

**Additional notes:**

If you instead navigate to http://localhost:6006/?path= (`path` param intentionally left blank) then the Storybook behaves as expected.
